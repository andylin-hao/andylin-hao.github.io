This is Hao Lin, a 5th-year PhD student working with Prof. Zhenhua Li at School of Software, Tsinghua University. I also spent a short yet wonderful time with Prof. Tianyin Xu at UIUC. My wish is to <a href="https://mygeekwisdom.com/2011/09/11/try-not-do-or-do-not-there-is-no-try/">do</a> hardcore and <a href="https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science">beautiful</a> system research. My current interests mainly cover mobile operating systems and virtualization systems. If you are interested in my research projects, please check them out below. Also, I (randomly) write some <a href="https://www.linhao.me/year-archive/">tech blogs</a> to document my experiences. Hope they'll benefit you as well!
