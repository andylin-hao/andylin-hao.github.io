This is Hao Lin, a PhD student working with <a href="https://www.thucloud.com/zhenhua/">Prof. Zhenhua Li</a> at School of Software, Tsinghua University. I'm currently visiting <a href="https://tianyin.github.io/">Prof. Tianyin Xu</a> at UIUC. My goal is to <a href="https://mygeekwisdom.com/2011/09/11/try-not-do-or-do-not-there-is-no-try/">do</a> useful and <a href="https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science">beautiful</a> system research. My current interests mainly cover mobile operating systems and virtualization systems. If you are interested in my research projects, please check them out below. Also, I (randomly) write some <a href="https://www.linhao.me/year-archive/">tech blogs</a> to document my experiences. Hope they'll benefit you as well!
